Forge

Forge is a website that is built around the needs of construction companies needs.

Forge will allow users to setup their own accounts. Accounts will then allow multiple users to be granted access. 

Users will be able to enter bids they have submitted. If they end up landing the project they bid on, they will be able to turn that into a current project.

Under current projects they will be able to place crew members.
